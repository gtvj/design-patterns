# Design patterns

Personal project exploring various software design patterns. Each pattern is categorised as either **creational**, **structural**, or **behavioural**.

## Creational

### Factory

Provides a generic interface for creating objects where we can specify the type
of object we wish to be created. The factory method is used ***to create one
product***

### Abstract factory

An abstract factory contains one or more factory methods to create a family of
related object. This pattern is about creating ***families of related products
***
